This is a short add-on for blender that synchronizes the render ports with the current view ports through the click of a button in the collections panel.
It is necessary to click every time you want to synchronise.

Installation:
1. Download the compressed folder "sync_render_with_view.zip"
2. Copy the unpacked folder into the blender add-ons folder (something like C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 2.83\2.83\scripts\addons)
3. Open the Add-ons Menu within blender: Edit > Preferences > Add-Ons (in the left menu)
4. Search for "Sync Render with Viewport" and activate the add-on by ticking the little box.

After these steps, the synchronizatio button should appear in the view ports pannel.
